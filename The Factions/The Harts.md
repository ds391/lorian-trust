The Harts of Albion are the Knights and Nobles of Albion, guarding the land, protecting the people and upholding the law. The Realm of Albion is the land of Arthur from the times of Legend. The People of Albion are predominantly Human with tribes of Elves, Courts of the Fey, and packs of Beastkin who call this land their home. Albion is steeped in family names and lineages, but rank and honour come from ability, and worth is determined by deed. You may arrive at Court a farmhand - to raise yourself to the Rank of Knight or to lead a Noble House. From the heathered York moors and the snow-crowned fells of Keswick in the North, through to the shaded eaves of Gloucester’s Great Greenwood and the rolling meadows of Winchester to the sheer cliffs of Cornwall in the South - Albion waits for you to live and breathe your destiny.

For all their renown as good and honourable folk, be vigilant, for that friendly word may hide a spell, that open hand may hide a dagger, and that tea may hide a poison. As Albion finds its place on an ever-changing Egg, the people of the Harts are ever ready to take up the sword should the need arise. Should your cause be just and right and true, you’ll find the Harts of Albion marching by your side. The people of Albion soldier on against Darkness, Chaos, and Evil.
