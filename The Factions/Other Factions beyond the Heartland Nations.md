There are many more Continents and Factions beyond the Heartland Nations – some resembling closely the Factions mentioned above, others vastly different. Some of these nations are close to the Heartland Nations and have some contact and trade with the factions (such as Cathay and Nihon) whilst others are only names mentioned in stories and legend. Each of these Factions, Nations and Continents are inhabited by creatures similar to the Heartland Nations and live, work, fight, Trade and survive in the same way as many others. Some of these Nations are primitive (yet powerful) whilst others are unfathomably advanced compared to the Heartland Nations – each helping or hindering their lands and people and on occasion bringing war and peace to their lands.
