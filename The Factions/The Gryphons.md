The Gryphons represent the twinned kingdoms of Estragales and Lyonesse, united under one banner (that of The Lord Gryphon). The two nations fight for the individual faiths, rights and territories of their people, defending them with a fierce sense of pride, and an ingrained code of chivalry. The faction call "All For One, One For All", the unity of these two nations is undeniable, and is core to the Faction identity. Gryphons do not hide their contempt for all aspects of Unlife, but welcome those from all walks of life, and an eclectic mix of cultures and creeds into their society.

The Lord/Lady Gryphon is the ruler of the Gryphon nation. They are appointed by the monarchs of Estragales and Lyonesse to rule and govern on their behalf. The people of the Gryphons vary greatly and among them you will find Elves, Dwarves, Men and Beastkin, merchants, craftsmen, soldiers and priests; all united under one banner. The culture of the Gryphons is one of high civilisation, law and order - striving to do what is right (whenever possible) and standing as a rock of principal and tradition in a world of Chaos and ruin. This is not to say that there have not been notable accidents and unfortunate deaths - it is just that these were expected ... shaving accidents. All quite normal, everyday shaving accidents. Life in the Gryphons can be as slow or as fast as you like, and life is for the living.
