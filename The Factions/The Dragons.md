The Dragons are technically a people of three nations: War-scarred Erin (known for breeding tenacious and bold warriors), the mysterious and sacred Isle of Caer Danon (a place of Great Magic and Spirituality) and Cymrija (a landscape of mountain ranges and sprawling wild forests). In this harsh land, civilisation survives and creates a hardy people - respectful of the Land in all its might and majesty. The three Nations are led by the Ri Draig/Rioghan Draig - Chosen by the People and of the People to serve and Honour the Ancestors. The people live lives of passion, ferocity, and fierce loyalty. For the Dragons, the Land and the People are one - If the people suffer, so does the Land. For Dragons the Ancestors, People, and Land are one woven pattern of existence. 

The Faction pride themselves for their Warriors, Leaders, Bards and Druids - understand the importance of protecting the natural cycle of life through the harshest of seasons. Spirited and fearless, throwing themselves into peril where others would hesitate, never accepting defeat or humiliation - a Dragon would rather die a hero than live in shame. The greatest honour for a Dragon is to serve the Land through Life, into Death and beyond - Living on through stories and songs of the Bards and Musicians.
