Mauritanja is a grouping of islands. The Mauritanja beneath your feet is a living, breathing land. She is the air that you breathe and the water you sail upon. Every path taken is an act of worship and every island (whilst different) is an integral part of the Greater whole. If you mean no harm to Mauritanja - you are welcome there; a huge number of the fringes of society, the outcasts, the different and the exotic have made this place their home. There is no normal - day to day you will brush shoulders with Olog traders, Elven story weavers, Summoned Daemons and Heralds of the Ancestors.

Headed by the Lord/Lady Unicorn (Elected by the people of Mauritanja) - this leader chooses Consuls to assist them in the running of the lands with Trade, magic and the pushing of world Knowledge being the elixir of their success. A nation of Navigators and Sailors with quality and quantity on offer, the Unicorn Faction have contacts and trading partnerships way beyond the other Heartland nations - this also means they are more than prepared to protect what they have or even take what you have (by whatever means). For those wishing adventure, there is no better Faction to explore than that of the Unicorn Faction.
