Many decades ago - the Lions Faction were exiled from their Ancestral home of Albion after losing a Civil War and migrated to the mystical Plane of Avalon, from there they faced hardship and reformation only to be crushed by the unfathomable Evil of the Nosta Kar forcing a fighting retreat of the War forged Lions back to the Heartlands and the Archipelago of Lantia, a circle of islands between Teutonia to the north and Aegyptus to the south. With the last great Cataclysm, the mirror realm of Orst merged with the islands, changing the islands and the geography of the islands that had remained that way for millennia.

Most races have some representation in the Lions Faction with one of the most famous Kings being a Dwarf. They are a people of diversity from former Albione Knights to secretive Orstian Fey, with everything and everyone in-between. Having lost two homes already, the Lions are sworn not to lose Lantia. Lantia is ruled by a non-hereditary King or Queen selected based on merit. Although the Lions have extensive laws - the spirit matters more than the letter. Corruption and Necromancy are unwelcomed in Lions lands and Lions found using these powers may face punishment - those with Unliving patterns have no rights under Lions law.
