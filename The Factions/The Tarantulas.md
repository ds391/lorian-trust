Of the Heartland Nation Factions - the Tarantulas are by far the most unique. Where societies of the Surface can be reasonably compared and contrasted, the Tarantula Faction is cold and unnerving to outsiders. There is one rule in the Underdark: Donâ€™t Get caught. There is one Law - that of the Valsharess (The Drow Royal Leader of the Underdark - or the Advisors that rule in their absence). The Tarantula Lands are enormous subterranean caverns, tunnels, rivers and lakes that span the length and breadth of the Heartlands (collectively referred to as The Underdark). The Faction has a high concentration of Drow, Norns, Elves and Dark Elves. Faith is the beating dark Heart of the Underdark and its zealous fanaticism is the fiery blood in its veins.

Life in the Underdark is dangerous and brutal for polite description, forging a people of keen wit and razorsharp focus. When in their own lands, the people fight, kill, steal and do whatever they can to progress and succeed - with cunning, guile, planning and cold execution being respected above all else. When the banners are unfurled, and the Horns of War are sounded - the nation rises as one to focus for the Nation above all else. The Tarantula Nation is a dangerous Ally and an even more dangerous Enemy with every tool, trick and advantage used to further its Glory. Masters of Death and Prayer - the Children of Llolth worship with the Blade for the Glory of the Nation.
