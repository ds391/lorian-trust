The hardy people from a cold land with warm hearts and fiery resolve; in a harsh climate it pays to be generous to your neighbour, as you may one day rely on them. This is the backbone of the Wolves faction - and when the wind blows chill, passion and spirit can shatter continents. The Wolves venerate Ancestors and honour traditions, that is not to say they are blind slaves to the old ways - the Wolves Faction have vision beyond that of other Nations and have used that advantage to rise above others. A warrior people sometimes accused of being single minded (often proven to be a false and costly mistake for those that whisper it) mistaking fearlessness for foolishness. The minds are as sharp as the axe that splits your shield and rends your armour.

Like their namesake they are a Pack - protecting the old, wise and sometimes weak, to continue the health, wealth and strong Family bonds of the Nation. Just like a Pack they hunt and distribute the share of that hunt to all with everyone - feasting in the Great Langhus late into the night, telling stories of the Ancestors and those that sit beside them in Valhalla. When the Dawn breaks the battle lines form, the Wolves march to War and the Blades blunt on the resolve of their Shield wall.
