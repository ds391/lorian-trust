The Vipers are the people of the enormous landmass of Teutonia, stretching from the icy Grey Sea in the north all the way to the Blistering heat of the South Sea. It borders the Bretton sea to the west with the vast expanse of the Great Forest of Teutonia to the east. It has a single land border with the lands of Estragales. With varied geography with numerous mountain ranges, rivers, lakes and forests, there are many places of interest including the Blood Marshes (with its horde of unliving), the Elementally charged Reis Astrobleim, the Daemonic Portal of Trieste and the magnificent World Wonder of the carved burial tombs of the ancient kings at Crotalus Nex.

Teutonia is a monarchy - rarely seen away from Court and in his stead, His Majesty appoints a Lord Protector to govern the Viper Nation, who in turn is supported by a Lord Commander to govern the military and a Lord Chancellor to govern the civilian people. The Vipers are generally descended from the Teutonic tribes that lived on the fringe of the Old Empire. They have a robust and practical culture passed down from the Gothic Knightly Orders in the North of Germania, spiced with the richly creative decadence of the Italian peninsula. It is not unusual to see people of any race or pattern type. Viper society is liberal, and the people enjoy a large degree of personal freedom to live how they wish and pursue their own goals (within the Laws naturally).
