A spell cast repeatedly must have a minimum of 3 seconds between the end of the vocals of the end of the last spell and the start of the next casting of that same spell. For example, a Mage wishes to cast a blast spell repeatedly at a target. They cast the spell using the vocals “By my power I Blast your chest”. There is then a count of 3 seconds before that blast spell may be cast again by the same Spellcaster. This only applies to chain-casting of the same spell, if another spell is cast between there is no delay in the ability to cast.
