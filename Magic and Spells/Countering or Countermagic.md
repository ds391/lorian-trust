A Countermagic will prevent a spell or effect from working (except where the description or effect explicitly states that it cannot be countered) E.g. A countermagic can counter a Fear Effect - but cannot counter a Mass Fear. A Countermagic cannot counter another Countermagic, a High Countermagic cannot counter another High Countermagic BUT a High Countermagic CAN counter a Countermagic. So, under normal circumstances the process will be: Spell cast, a countermagic cast against that spell, High Magic is cast against the normal Countermagic (and cannot itself be countered) â€“ the original cast spell is then successful.
