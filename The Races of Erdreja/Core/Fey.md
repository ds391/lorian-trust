The Fey are an unusual Race with other races viewing fey as otherworldly or unnecessarily chaotic. The Fey see the patterns in the chaos (or at least they claim to) - it is the changeability, variety, and this uniqueness of the Fey that defines them. No two Fey are identical (except of course when they are - and then that is unique ... see?). Fey are creatures of belief, what they believe about themselves (deep down in their core) affects who they are. Fey can be very long lived, and it is said that the fey alone can remember parts of past lives, however fey also sometimes lose access to the memories of their current life. Fey often have what is referred to as Glamour, this is optional and is usually shown with makeup effects. Fey makeup can be as simple or complex as you choose, and can incorporate prosthetics, glitter or even wings (sadly these will not grant the ability to fly).
