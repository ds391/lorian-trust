Before the times of the Empire, little history remains other than that of the humans being the enslaved race of the Elves and other creatures. What is known is that the early civilisations of man were diverse and varied, despite being a primitive culture in many places, from fragile beginnings, a thriving race developed all across the known world. What Is known is that humans learned from or were taught by their masters. the secrets of Magic - and with this new knowledge eventually rebelled. The Race Wars ravaged Erdreja until after much suffering the Humans rose victorious. The Empire of Man rose and fell with other parts of Erdreja becoming refuge for the Elves. Humans are as diverse as can be with many cultures, societies and ways of living within - your imagination can run riot and Human characters are part of all the Factions of the Heartland Nations and can easily fit within their histories and stories.
