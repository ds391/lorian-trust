The majority of Dwarves live below ground or in fortified holds (often in mountainous areas). It is said that they are more numerous in the southern lands of Erdreja, but there are many famous ancient Dwarven strongholds scattered throughout Erdreja. Dwarves are known to have incredible natural talents in mining, engineering and the working of metals. The Dwarven love of crafting has long been known and their skills are often sought after in the Heartlands. Many Dwarf players favour the classic fantasy look of Dwarves - Beards (regardless of Gender or lack of), heavy armour and Axes - Other favour a more genteel look with runes and craftwork of items and clothing bringing their interpretation of a Dwarf to life. The Dwarves have had a long influence across Erdreja, and their people can be found in all Factions where they are welcomed as their own.
