Fearsome creatures, whose ancestry is lost to the most Ancient of days, it is known that the differing types of Ologs occasionally retain the strangest of powers from the days of the Race Wars. Corrupted beyond all measure of their beginnings, no one can know what these creatures were in the beginning. Yet whatever form that might have once walked the lands in, they would have been terrible to behold. The most common of Olog races are Trolls and Ogres. Ogres are the more knowledgeable of their kin and have a preference of mastering magic. Trolls tend to be the more physical kin - leaning towards the more martial of skills. Ologs tend to be Clan-like in their societies yet would prefer their own company if given a choice. Ologs can have quite long lives and as such their societies tend to respect the elderly of their Race far more than other races might. Ologs tend to be the larger creatures of the fantasy world. Options for costume can include masks and padding to increase your overall size or interesting prosthetics to emphasise your vision of the Race.
