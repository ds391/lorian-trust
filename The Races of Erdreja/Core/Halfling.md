Halflings were created by the Dwarves. Subsets of the race include Kender and Hobbits. Common traits are a strong sense of curiosity, wonder and exploration (which leads both to their reputation as great adventurers), as well as their habit of acquiring trinkets and objects of interest. It is also said that a Halfling love of cake and sweets is comparable to the Dwarven love of Gold. Halflings have the advantage that, never having had their own Empire or major problem as a race during history, they have no historical baggage or grudges as a Race (other than the mistaken belief by some that they are all pickpockets). Halfling characters tend to be recognisable by their style rather than by bodily characteristics (with the exception of a traditional Kender topknot). Bright colours and a certain flamboyance are also a popular theme of some Halflings.
