The Beastkin are intelligent animal like creatures who draw their forms from many of the wild animals of Erdreja. In the Heartlands some Beastkin band together in groups, but others live solitary lives. Legends speak of kinship with Werewolves and other Lycanthropes, although in fact there are significant differences. Beastkin have a lifespan similar to humans. Examples of common Beastkin include, Wolfkin, Foxkin and Ratkin. Some Beastkin have an obvious similarity to a specific animal, while other beastkin are more generically animalistic. They can be kin to any beast you choose mammal, bird, insect, amphibian or fish. An accepted part of role playing a Beastkin is an appearance that in some way resembles your chosen creature, whether through use of make-up, prosthetics or just costume. The most common way to represent a generic Beastkin look is “Beastkin Stripe” which is achieved by using two different colours of make up across the eyes and bridge of the nose.
