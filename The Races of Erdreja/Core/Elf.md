The Elves are one of the four races created by the Elemental Dragons. Beyond the Age of Legends (Mythical times of the Early millennia of Erdreja), as humans spread across the world, Elves decided that these races should be subjugated, and refused to teach them higher magics. Eventually the humans rebelled - starting the first Race War. After the Elves and their allies lost the race war, much of the Heartlands was ruled by the (Mostly Human) Empire, and those Elves that survived were forced to flee. The Empire eventually fell and since then elves have made their home in every land of Erdreja. The Great Kingdoms of the Elves have long since crumbled, but the legacy lives on. Many players choose to wear prosthetic ear tips, either by using prosthetic ear tips. While Elves can have very long life spans, it is advisable to role-play vague and misty memories of events many millennia ago - and keep detail of recent histories as more part of your background and character
