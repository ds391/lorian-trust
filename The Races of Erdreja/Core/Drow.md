The Drow predominantly live below ground in a network of vast caverns and tunnels, known as the Underdark. The Drow of the Heartlands mostly follow the ancestor Llolth (The Spider Queen) and consequentially they tend to be a matriarchal society and have great reverence for spiders. Drow societies tend to be extremely ordered (although actual Laws may be limited) - as well as being harsh by the standards of other Races. Groups and Families are more often referred to as Houses, with lineage and Ancestry threading back to Llolth herself being particularly respected. When playing a Drow the accepted norm is to have dark makeup, often a grey or stone colour (not flat black) following a mystical or other-worldly theme. Some players have created great effects using dark blue or purple to highlight features such as cheekbones and the nose. Prosthetic ear tips are popular, and wigs (often white or purple) bring a great look to the Race.
