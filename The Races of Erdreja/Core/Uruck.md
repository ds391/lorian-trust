The truth of the histories of the Uruck Races is not known. Orcs, Goblins and others of the green skinned Race can be clan-like, tribal, and adverse to methods of record keeping. These creatures have lived in their hundreds and thousands for countless centuries. It is known that many large tribes played significant parts in the Race Wars, and that the bulk of their numbers took the side of the Humans with some of the Uruck clans still harbouring grudges against the Dwarves and Elves. In the days of the Empire, the Uruck races were granted the same opportunities of citizenship as anyone else, should they choose to accept them. Many others remained outside of the Imperial fold and took to roaming the vast wildernesses of Teutonia and other lands. Urucks are Orcs, Goblins and Gnolls for the most part. Anyone wanting to play any of these as characters or similar fantasy races should choose Uruck as their race. The accepted norm is a green colour for the Orc and Goblin based races and textured browns (not flat brown) for the Kobold and Gnolls
