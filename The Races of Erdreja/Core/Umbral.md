The Umbral races are made up of myriad other races that are not entirely pure or native to Erdreja. Examples of Umbral races are Half Fiends, Half Constructs, Voidkin or any race that is derived from an Ancestral, Demonic or Elemental race. There is little common knowledge about the Umbral races as they are rare and not always friendly. This Race category is in place to allow your imagination and creativity to make the world a richer and more interesting place (if none of the other categories above interest you). The only limitations that we insist on are that your ideas stay within the Family-Friendly attitudes and standards of The Lorien Trust and that you do not use Flat Black or Brown Makeup to represent your characters skin colour (as mentioned in the Drow and Uruck descriptions) as well as being sensitive to racist or insensitive real-life inspiration ideas.
