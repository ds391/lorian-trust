Some of these creatures naturally occur on Erdreja â€“ but the truly unusual Mineral and Plant creatures are created from powerful Rituals. These creatures often have requirements for healing or repair that other creatures do not. With their creation these Plant/Mineral Creatures can gain exotic powers or traits (or have the potential to develop them as they grow). Examples of Plant Creatures include: Shambling Mound, Dryad and Triffid. Examples of Mineral Creatures include: Clay Construct, Golem and Animated Rock Creature.
