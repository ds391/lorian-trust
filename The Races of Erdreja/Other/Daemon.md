Creatures of Chaos and Magic - Linked to the Void (the Magical place of Raw Power that surrounds Erdreja and bathes it in energy - allowing it to Grow). These creatures can be summoned to Erdreja from the Void and be crafted to survive (and often thrive) in the Factions and Lands of the Heartland Nations. They are often Magical or unusual in nature and are not something that naturally occurs or is created on Erdreja, and often have requirements for healing or repair that other creatures do not. With their creation (often via a Ritual performed on another creature) these Daemons can gain exotic powers or traits (or have the potential to develop them as they grow). One of the downsides of being a Daemon is the vulnerability of being Dismissed (a form of banishing or destroying â€“ generally sending the Daemon creature back to the Void - effectively killing them) - however, most Daemon creatures live with this additional threat and bring their unique pattern to the world of Erdreja. Examples of Daemons include: Imps, Demonkin, Overlord.
