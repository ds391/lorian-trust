Creatures of Faith and Prayer - linked to the Ancestors (Deities/Creatures of Worship and Prayer). These creatures can be summoned to Erdreja from the Plane of the Ancestors and be crafted to survive (and often thrive) in the Factions and Lands of the Heartland Nations. They are often Magical or unusual in nature and are not something that naturally occurs or is created on Erdreja, and often have requirements for healing or repair that other creatures do not. With their creation (often via a Ritual performed on another creature) these Ancestrals can gain exotic powers or traits (or have the potential to develop them as they grow). One of the downsides of being an Ancestral is the vulnerability of being Dismissed (a form of banishing or destroying â€“ generally sending the Ancestral creature back to the Plane of the Ancestors - effectively killing them) - however, most Ancestral creatures live with this additional threat and bring their unique pattern to the world of Erdreja. Examples of Ancestral include: Spirit, Daeva, Archon, Avatar.
