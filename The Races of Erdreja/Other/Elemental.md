Creatures of the sixteen Elements of Erdreja (Earth, Air, Magic, Chaos, Time etc.) - Linked to the Elemental Planes (the Magical place of Mystery, Chaos and Power - a swirling soup of Elemental consciousness). These creatures can be summoned to Erdreja from the Elemental Planes and be crafted to survive (and often thrive) in the Factions and Lands of the Heartland Nations. They are often Magical or unusual in nature and are not something that naturally occurs or is created on Erdreja, and often have requirements for healing or repair that other creatures do not. With their creation (often via a Ritual performed on another creature) these Elementals can gain exotic powers or traits (or have the potential to develop them as they grow). One of the downsides of being an Elemental is the vulnerability of being Dismissed (a form of banishing or destroying â€“ generally sending the Elemental creature back to the Elemental Planes - effectively killing them) - however, most Elemental creatures live with this additional threat and bring their unique pattern to the world of Erdreja. Examples of Elementals include: Zephyr, Servitor, Ifrit, Djinn.
