• The Ritual of Peace is an event-wide magical effect that last from Time-in (10am) to Midnight (12pm) at all Lorien Trust Main Events. Any Character with one of the Ten Factions (Bears, Dragons, Gryphons, Harts, Jackals, Lions, Tarantulas, Unicorns, Vipers or Wolves) listed on their character card will be protected by this effect. Creatures with Unliving Patterns, Magical Patterns, Alien Patterns and some unusual Patterns are not covered by the Ritual of Peace. 

• The Ritual of Peace prevents LHV being taken to -1 (by converting it to Subdue Damage excluding specific powerful and unique effects). Some Damage Effects such as Harm or Damage types such as Artefact will ignore the Ritual of Peace and can take LHV to -1. These effects have explicit wording explaining in their descriptions.

**Healing and Recovery under the Ritual of Peace**

• Living Patterns with Head or Torso LHV at zero who are under the Ritual of Peace for 10 minutes will recover all of their LHV but will be Debilitated for a further 10 minutes*.

**Healing and Recovery without the Ritual of Peace**

• Characters with their Head and Torso at zero for 30 minutes will recover 1 LHV (Head and Torso) and become debilitated (may crawl instead of walking slowly). In addition, a character in this state may only perform actions that do not require concentration.

*See Debilitation entries for further details - Some effects such as Disease, Decay or Fatal will prevent LHV recovery from happening. At time-out all characters with LHV at zero will fully recover for the next day.*

**Unusual Creatures in Erdreja** Some creatures have only a single LHV (commonly known as a Global Hit Creature). These creatures are not attainable as player characters and will generally be plot creatures or characters. These creatures will take and recover damage in a different way to other creatures but will follow all other rules listed in this handbook.
