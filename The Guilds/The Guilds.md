The Guilds are non-factional organisations that specialise in particular areas. They support the Factions and their People with Training, materials, advice and information and are a place for crafting, trade, banking entertainment and more. These are supported by a team of NPCs (Non-Player Character) and DPCs (Designated or Directed Player Characters) who assist the customers within each Guild at events.
