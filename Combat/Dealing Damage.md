Dealing Damage Any blow struck with a weapon will deal a single point of damage unless an effect states otherwise. Armour cannot be reduced below 0 AV (Armour Value), and body locations cannot be reduced below â€“1 LHV (Locational Hit Value). (See Damage System) If a character has AV from two different sources (e.g. a Magical Paladins Armour and Mundane Chainmail) then both sets of Armour will take damage at the same time if struck.
