Out of Combat Being out of combat refers to a situation where a character is not actively or passively participating in a combat situation. This includes healing others, preparing to or anticipating combat (your concentration being focussed on the combat rather than elsewhere). This is a grey area and we ask that where it is referenced in the rules that the Spirit of the Rules be used so that a range of situations can be fairly covered without resorting to an extensive list. This situation mainly comes into play when repairing Armour and Occupational Skills associated with Armour Repair.
