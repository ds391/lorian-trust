Grace Periods A character’s Grace Period is the time between them receiving a Mortal Wound and them dying. Some effects can put you directly into your Grace Period, but if a character is put into a Grace Period for any reason, they will die when the Grace Period expires. A Grace Period is normally 10 minutes in length, If a character becomes the target of an effect that would enter them into their Grace Period whilst they are already in their Grace Period, they do not gain a second. Instead their Grace Period will continue using the lowest time of the two (time left of the original Grace Period, or the new Grace Period if it is shorter).

While all locations are at -1 you may not regenerate damage unless a Loresheet or Lammie specifically states that you may regenerate when at -1 on all locations. Note: This does not affect normal curative or healing actions, only the Regeneration effect. The Grace Period is the time during which the character’s Pattern is departing their physical body. To be brought out of their Grace Period, all reasons for the character to be in their Grace Period must be resolved.
