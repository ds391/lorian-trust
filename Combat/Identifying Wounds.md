Discerning Mortal Wounds Once every 10 seconds any character can identify if a character has any location with a Mortal Wound or is dead. This identification takes 3 seconds of Concentration whilst within 10ft (~3m) of the target and they must state "Discern Mortal Wounds" to the target player. This is an OOC vocal. The type and number of blows is not discernible by this method. The targeted character should respond with “No mortal Wounds Detected” or “Mortal Wound (s) (Location(s)” or “Dead” This is an OOC response.

Discerning Wounds Characters with the CS Healing, Corruption or Triage (Advanced) can Discern Wounds. Using this skill requires 3 seconds of concentration, while holding your primary hand approx. 1ft away from a single target, and stating "Discern Wound, Poison, Pattern Effect or Disease". The targeted character should respond with “Dead” or the number of hits remaining on each location and the number of hits each location can be restored to - plus the location of any Fatal effect. Additionally this discern will also reveal the presence of any of the following effects: Disease, Decay, Dismiss, Petrify, Paralysis, Poison or Smite.
