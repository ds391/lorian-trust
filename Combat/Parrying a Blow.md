Parrying a Blow If a blow from a weapon delivering a special attack is parried, the special attack will not affect you. Arrows and crossbow bolts must not be parried by a weapon. If an arrow accidentally strikes your weapon it should be ruled to have struck the limb location of the weapon you are holding (or primary location for a large weapon) instead. It is acceptable to block arrows with a shield, providing you take-care not to deflect them onto others. A weapon must be held to parry a blow and you must possess the skill to wield the weapon. Any blow striking a slung weapon will not be considered to be parried and will still damage any location it strikes. You may not parry a blow with a weapon or shield you do not have the skill to use, if you do, the strike and any special effects it has will still affect you.
