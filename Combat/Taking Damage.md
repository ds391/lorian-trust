Taking Damage Every time your character is hit on an armoured body location, you should deduct one from the AV of that body location (if you are wearing a suitable Phys-rep for your armour and have the skill enabling you to use it). If you are struck on an unarmoured body location, or on a body location covered by armour with its AV at zero, you should deduct one hit from that body locationâ€™s hits. If a body location is reduced to zero LHV, it is rendered unusable.
