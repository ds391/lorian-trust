Smite (Pattern Enchant Effect) 
• Smite only affects Unliving patterns 
• The Smite default damage type is Enchanted (Unless preceded by an Elemental Weakness or Artefact e.g. Earth Smite will ignore the Immunity to Smite) 
• Ignores all armour 
• Destroys the body location (Ignoring the Ritual of Peace) 
• Places the Target into their Grace Period until the Smite effect is removed 
• To remove a smite effect the target must receive 30 continuous seconds of a Wasting effect (The Wasting normally targets Living patterns but may target the Unliving as a cure effect for Smite and will have no further effects).
