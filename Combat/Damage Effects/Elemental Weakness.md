Elemental Weakness /<X/> (See Earth/Air/Flame/Water Damage Effects and the Elemental Weakness listing in the Character Creation section). Any combat call that includes the named damage type or effect cannot be resisted by any means. All other aspects of the call remain unchanged. Any damage caused by an Elemental Weakness call will not breach a Ritual Of Peace unless it would normally do so without the Elemental Weakness tag. Every creature will have at least one Elemental Weakness tag. Example: A character with an Elemental Weakness of Water is struck by a Water Paralysis blow. The target must take the Paralysis effect even if they would otherwise be able to resist it by some means (such as the Immunity to Paralysis or the occupational Skill Immune to Immobilisation).
