Corrosion (Magical Damage Effect) 
• Inflicts 1 point of Enchanted damage against the AV (Armour Value – AV, MAV and NAV) of the targeted Location (Against all other targets it inflicts the default damage type of the blow - Normal unless otherwise stated) 
• An additional Corrosion effect will occur against all Armour types After 30 seconds the armour effectiveness will reduce by 1 and will continue to reduce every 30 seconds. If a purge poison effect is used on the armour location or the armour location is reduced to zero the Corrosion effect ends. Alternatively, a character with the Repair Enchanted Item or Repair Destroyed item may roleplay removing damaged sections of the affected armour and remove the Corrosion effect from the location – this action will take 30 seconds per location.
