Fatal (Pattern Enchant Effect) 
• Fatal only affects Living patterns 
• The Fatal default damage type is Enchanted (Unless preceded by an Elemental Weakness or Artefact e.g. Earth Fatal will ignore the Immunity to Fatal) • Ignores all armour 
• Destroys the body location (Ignoring the Ritual of Peace) • Places the Target into their Grace Period 
• Prevents healing or cure of wounds (including regeneration and triage) from affecting the Target until all Fatal Wound effects on all the targets locations are removed (max. 1 Fatal Wound effect per location – a target can may have several Fatal effects applied at the same time – different locations)
