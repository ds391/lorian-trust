If you are capable of generating a Damage effect it is in addition to, and separate from, the Damage Type done by the weapon blow itself. All blows do 1 point of damage, the damage effect will never add another point of damage to the blow although it may negate the damage or convert the point of damage into destroying a location or armour instead. E.g. If you are struck by a Harm on an armoured location the Harm converts the normal point of damage into an effect that destroys the location but does not damage the armour. Some of the damage effects only work on a specific Target Group. If the Target Group is not on a lammie (Inc. your character card) or on a loresheet, then it is considered to be a blow of the damage type used (Normal if no other damage type is called), unless you are told otherwise by a Referee or Marshal. Note that everyone defaults to the Target Group, Living, unless otherwise specified on a lammie or loresheet. Any effect listed can also be used as a Damage effect. Unless explicitly stated the target will be aware that they are affected by the Damage Effects below.
