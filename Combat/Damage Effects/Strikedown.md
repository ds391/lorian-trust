Strikedown (Physical Force Effect) 
• Forces the target to the floor so they must crouch with one or both knees touching the ground (or a similar prone position) and remain in a prone position for 10 seconds. 
• Holding onto an object or person will not prevent you from taking the Strikedown effect (you may still be moved using the normal carrying rules). 
• Whilst struck down the target may take any action they would normally be able to (as long as it is safe to do so) which includes fighting, casting or moving safely whist in a prone position. 
• Whilst under a Strikedown effect you are not a valid target for any further Strikedown effects.
