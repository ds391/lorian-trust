r You cannot be specifically immune to Silver damage types unless you are also immune to Normal damage. Please note that every creature is likely to have a weakness â€“ regardless of any immunities that you can gain. If you are struck by your particular damage type (in any form) you will be affected by it as described later in this publication. It is possible for creatures to become immune to Spells, Damage, Effects or even Curses (with varying degrees of difficulty).
