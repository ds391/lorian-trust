If you are Immune only to a damage effect then you ignore everything listed in the effect description but will still take the damage type of the weapon. E.g. if you are Immune to pattern effects or the Fatal effect and are struck by a normal Fatal to an armoured location you simply take a point of normal damage to the armour. The Fatal effect is ignored and does not convert the damage to Enchanted. If you are immune to the fatal effect and you are wearing magical armour that would normally be destroyed by the fatal effect â€“ it is also immune to the Fatal effect (but will instead take a point of normal damage from the blow)
