Any Immunity to damage types and effects that apply to either the character or their armour will cover both. E.g. if your armour is immune to normal damage, then so are you. If you are Immune only to the damage type of a blow, then you must still take the damage effect. E.g. if you are Immune to normal and are struck by a normal paralysis blow then you will not take any damage from the blow but will still take the paralysis effect.
