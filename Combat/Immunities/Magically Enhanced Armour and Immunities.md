Magically enchanted armour that offer immunity to damage types and effects that apply to either the character or their armour will cover both. These types of armour (that require the CS Armour use and require an attached lammie) only offer the immunity and/or benefit if the armour worn is of a single type. E.g. it is not possible to wear a Light Armour Torso Breastplate that offers the character the DR Crush immunity AND wear a Light Armour Helmet that grants Immune to Through (combining both immunities across all locations)
