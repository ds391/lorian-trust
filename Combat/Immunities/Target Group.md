p Some damage effects convert the damage type of the weapon based on the target being in a Target Group. If you are not in the Target Group, you will take the default damage type of the weapon. E.g. if you are an elf struck by a Human Bane weapon, you will take a point of normal damage from the blow, if you were a human struck by the same weapon the armour would be bypassed and the location will be Destroyed by Artefact damage.
